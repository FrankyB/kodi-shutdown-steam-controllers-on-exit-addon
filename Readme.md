Shutdown Steam Controllers on Kodi exit.

Useful if your rig repowers on poweroff because the steam controllers are still switched on.

Works only in conjunction with sc-controller (https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller) in Linux

sc-controller has to run as the same user as kodi does, else you have to modify resources/lib/shitdownsteamcontrollers.sh

Install:
On console:
 - make

in Kodi: 
 - add Addon from ZIP file
 - select the generated zip

Tested on Kodi 18.9
